I currently work as a research analyst at Flatiron Institute, NYC, under the mentorship of Dr. SueYeon Chung. I am a recent graduate from Macaulay Honors College at Hunter College CUNY and an aspiring PhD. I am generally interested in the intersection between artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience, particularly in the representation of information in complex systems.
