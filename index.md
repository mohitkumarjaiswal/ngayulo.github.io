## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="/images/headshot22sq.jpg"/>

I am a research analyst at Flatiron Institute, NYC. I am a recent graduate from Macaulay Honors College at Hunter College CUNY and an asprining PhD. Currently being mentored by Dr. SueYeon Chung, I am generally interested in the intersection between artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience, particularly in the representation of information in complex systems.
